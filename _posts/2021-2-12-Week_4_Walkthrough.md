<h1>Hello and welcome to week 4 of ESPM 112L-</h1>

<h1>Metagenomic Data Analysis Lab!</h1>

* TOC

This week's lab is one of the most fun of the semester- you all are going to get to do some manual binning with our lab's tool, ggKbase!

ggKbase is a spectacular way to visualize the ways we separate out genomes from metagenomes, and unlike automatic binning software, you can see and control the whole process!

Similar platforms like Anvi'o (https://merenlab.org/software/anvio/) are available for manual binning, although slightly different from what you'll be using today.

# What is binning?

Remember, we start with a whole community of microorganisms, so we have DNA from multiple origin genomes.

The assembler, as you'll recall from last week, does a pretty good job of piecing these things together, but we're still left with fragments of these original genomes.

Binning is the process of choosing which of these fragments likely originated from the same genome, and stitching them together into genome bins (sometimes called MAGs, or Metagenome-Assembled Genomes, in the literature).

Each group will be binning their own sample this week, and this document will show you how.

# ggKbase

ggKbase is our lab's platform for metagenomic data analysis. Head on over to https://class.ggkbase.berkeley.edu; we're going to make each of you an account.
