        <h3> The Greater Sage Grouse</h3>

<span> The greater sage grouse (<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>) is a large bird that once roamed<br/>
<span> the majority of western North America, from British Columbia to Oklahoma. <a href="https://www.fws.gov/greatersagegrouse/speciesinfo.php"><small><font color="blue">(Source)</font></small></a> <br/>
<span> Today, its range is mostly limited to Wyoming, Montana, Nevada and Idaho. <br/> <br/>
<span> The sage grouse's habitat is defined by the presence of its main food source, <br/>
<span> the sage brush. As the range of the sage brush shrank, so too did the range <br/>
<span> of the sage grouse. <br/> <br/>

<span> Of interest, however, is the sage grouse's ability to digest the sage brush;<br/>
its high terpene content makes it unappealing for most would-be diners. <br/> <br/>

In collaboration with the <a href="http://www.kevindkohl.com/"><font color="blue">Kohl lab</font></a> at the University of Pittsburgh, I'm using <br/>
genome-resolved metagenomics techniques to study the metabolic capacity of <br/>
the bacteria that help the sage grouse digest its strange food.
