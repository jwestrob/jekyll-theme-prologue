Hi! I'm Jacob West-Roberts, a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley studying environmental science in the <a href="https://nanogeoscience.berkeley.edu/index.html#home"><b>Banfield Lab</b></a>. I'm especially interested in microbes that live in areas impacted by industrial or mining pollution, and how their unique metabolic capabilities can help develop and advance bioremediation techniques.

Before I came to UC Berkeley I studied at Carnegie Mellon University, where I got an M.S. in Computational Biology, and at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I got my B.A. in Molecular Biology.
